# Security Policy

For now, report security vulnerabilities as normal issues at https://github.com/benweissmann/dbsc-proxy/issues.

If this project ends up being used in production after DBSC is launched in at least one major browser, we'll move to private reporting at https://github.com/benweissmann/dbsc-proxy/security.
